I was able to fork the repo successfully.
I changed the server.js file to load in the external style sheet I created
I modified the starting index html file to include the following:
your name and class at WPI
your major
No previous computer science courses that you have taken at WPI
your experience with the following technologies and methods (none, some, a lot)
HTML
CSS
Java
JavaScript
Ruby
Python
unit testing
I left the package json file alone because it was doing what it was supposed to do
I used the proper naming conventions for the project in Glitch and in Github
Technical Achievements
I successfully changed the server.js file to handle an external style sheet
I successfully attached the external style sheet to the index.html file
I successfully used the style sheet inside the index.html file
I incorporated styles inline and from external sources
I used Glitch's asset system to get the exact URLs of the images on the page rather than use relative addresses.
I used z-index to overlay items for layout purposes.
Design Achievements
I used a variety of ways to absolutely position images and tables containing data to retain a layout that was planned outside of an .html editor
I edited tags inside the external style sheet to better maintain a cohesive design. For instance, the hyperlink tag is normal blue. This did not show up well on my page, so I changed it to ice or Alice blue.
I designed a dynamic layout that reflects my identity as an artist/game designer.
